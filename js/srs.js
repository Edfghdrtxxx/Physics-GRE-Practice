/* Spaced-repetition engine — shared by the mistake book and the formula deck.
   Two schedulers live here:
   - Mistake ladder: fixed intervals for missed questions. A miss (re)sets the
     entry to step 0 (due tomorrow); a correct solve climbs one rung. Entries
     are PERMANENT — solving never removes one, only schedules it further out;
     removal is the user's manual archive action.
   - Formula cards: classic Anki SM-2 with Again/Hard/Good/Easy grades, an
     ease factor per card, and day-granularity due dates. An optional
     exam-date cap (settings.formulaExamCap, default on) squeezes long
     intervals toward exam day without inverting grade order. In the last
     seven days before the exam, passing grades are held to one day
     (see finalPassActive). */
