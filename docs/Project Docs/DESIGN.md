# Physics GRE Prep Studio — Design Document

Personal, fully-local study site for the GRE Physics Test (exam day: **Wed, October 28, 2026**).
Everything runs from static files; all data stays on this machine (localStorage + IndexedDB).

---

## 1. Architecture

- **No build step.** Plain HTML/CSS/JS, hash-routed single page (`index.html` → `#/...`).
- **State** in `localStorage` (`pgre-state-v1`): XP, per-question/per-topic records,
  achievements, plan check-offs, streaks, daily counters, activity log.
- **Book content** in `IndexedDB` (`pgre-content`): raw imported markdown, chapter splits,
  chapter→topic mapping. Kept out of localStorage because of its ~5 MB quota.
- **Vendored libraries** (offline): `marked` (markdown → HTML), `KaTeX` + auto-render
  (math typesetting, `$...$`, `$$...$$`, `\(...\)`, `\[...\]`).
- **Aesthetic:** Anthropic-inspired — ivory ground (`#FAF9F5`), near-black ink (`#141413`),
  terracotta accent (`#CC785C`), serif display type, quiet cards, thin single-hue meters.

## 2. Gamification

### XP sources
| Event | XP |
|---|---|
| Correct answer | +10 (+5 extra the first time a question is solved) |
| Incorrect answer | +2 |
| Formula card reviewed | +2 (any grade; awarded quietly at session end) |
| Plan task | +10 to +50 (task-specific; granted once, survives un-checking) |
| Daily challenge | +10 to +30 |
| Achievement | Bronze +25 · Silver +50 · Gold +100 · Platinum +200 |

### Levels
Cumulative XP for level *n*: `50·n·(n−1)` → 0, 100, 300, 600, 1000, 1500, …
Titles climb the physics ladder: Quark → Electron → Photon → Atom → Molecule → Oscillator →
Wavefunction → Eigenstate → Hamiltonian → Lagrangian → Tensor → Quasar → Pulsar →
Neutron Star → Supernova → Nobel Laureate.

### Streaks & days
A day counts as active when ≥1 question is answered, a plan task completed, or a formula card reviewed.
Streak = consecutive active days (shown live; broken if the last active day is before yesterday).

### Daily challenges
3 per day, picked deterministically from a 6-item pool seeded by the date, auto-claimed
when their live counters (answers, correct-run, topics touched, plan tasks, notes visits) cross the goal.

### Achievements (36, hierarchical)
6 categories × 4 tiers. Chains (Problem Solver I–IV, streak 3/7/14/30, XP milestones, topic
mastery 1/3/6/9) create the hierarchy; five are secret (hidden until unlocked).
Defined in `js/data-achievements.js`; metric- or flag-based, checked centrally in
`gamify.checkAchievements()` (looped, since bonus XP can cascade into XP-milestone unlocks).

### Mastery
Per-topic mastery = share of that topic's question bank solved correctly at least once.
It will become more meaningful as the bank grows past the 20 preview questions.

## 3. Content pipeline — *status: SHIPPED (July 15, 2026 — parser v2 ran as an offline extraction pipeline)*

> **What shipped:** the book markdown was parsed offline (multi-agent extraction with
> adversarial verification, one agent per problem section / exam chunk / index chapter)
> into three **gitignored** generated files under `content/bank/`:
> `cpg-questions.js` (146 end-of-chapter problems, `PGRE.BOOK_QUESTIONS`, ids `cpg-<sec>-<n>`),
> `cpg-exams.js` (Sample Exams 1–3, 100 questions each, `PGRE.BOOK_EXAMS`, ids `cpg-x<n>-<q>`),
> `cpg-formulas.js` (334 formula cards, **strictly 1:1 with the book's numbered equations**
> per the EQUATION INDEX — user rule: only labeled equations are memorization-worthy;
> ids `cpgf-<eq>`). Referenced figures are copied to `content/book-assets/` (gitignored).
> ~96% of questions also carry `choiceSols` — per-choice distractor explanations mined
> from the worked solutions (see §8). `js/bank.js` merges preview + book + exam sources
> (`PGRE.allQuestions`, `questionById`, `questionsForTopic`); mastery denominators use the
> default pool (preview + chapter problems; exam questions are opt-in via the quiz builder
> to keep sims fresh). The pipeline is re-runnable; regenerated files simply overwrite.

> **Released ETS exams (2026-07-18):** seven real ETS exams (2024 practice book — the current
> 70-question format, with official P+ stats — plus GR1777/GR0877/GR0177/GR9677/GR9277/GR8677)
> are extracted from local PDFs (gitignored `docs/ETS Released Exams/`) by a multi-agent
> pipeline (transcribe → fidelity audit → blind-solve vs official key → reconcile) into
> gitignored `content/ets-src/`, then built by `tools/build-ets-exams.js` into gitignored
> `content/bank/ets-exams.js` (`PGRE.ETS_EXAMS`). The simulator replays them verbatim with the
> official answer key and each exam's own published raw→scaled table (`exam.scaledOfficial`).
> **Spoiler-protection rule (user-approved):** exam-sourced questions (`cpg-exam`, `ets-exam`)
> never enter the default practice pool — `{ includeExam: true }` is reserved for the
> simulator draw and by-id lookups (review, mistake book, analytics) so intact exams stay
> fresh for simulation. The three other `includeExam` consumers — global search, the
> custom-quiz "include sample-exam" toggle, and the weighted 70-question draw — filter
> `src === 'ets-exam'` back out (protective default, 2026-07-18), so only the book's
> sample exams flow through them. See CLAUDE.md → Content Rules.
> **Approved exception (2026-07-18):** GR8677 (1986) and GR9277 (1992) — the two oldest,
> least-representative forms — are deliberately broken up into ~200 daily-drill questions
> instead of mocks: built with `drill: true` into `PGRE.ETS_DRILLS` (src `ets-drill`), they
> DO join the default practice pool and are never listed in the simulator. The other five
> exams stay pristine under the rule above. Drill questions that near-duplicate a kept
> exam's question are quarantined (`meta.json → quarantine`) so they can't spoil that mock.

The site is frame-first: **20 preview questions** (hand-written, GRE-style, 5 choices)
spread across all 9 topics stand in until the *Conquering the Physics GRE* markdown arrives.

**Math convention:** all formulas — in question statements, choices, and solutions — are
authored as LaTeX inside `$...$` delimiters and typeset offline by KaTeX at render time
(`PGRE.typesetMath`, called after every practice-view render stage and on imported notes).
Anything added to the question bank, including parser-v2 output, must follow the same convention.

**Implemented now (Library page):**
- Drag-drop / file-picker import of any `.md` file → stored raw in IndexedDB.
- Naive splitter on `#`/`##` headings → sections.
- Manual section → topic mapping; mapped sections render (marked + KaTeX) in that
  topic portal's *Notes & reading* card.
- Importing sets the "The Tome Arrives" secret achievement.

**To build once the real file is here (parser v2):**
1. Inspect the actual markdown structure (chapter headings, problem blocks, solutions,
   answer keys — the book has end-of-chapter problems with worked solutions).
2. Write a structure-aware parser: chapter → topic auto-mapping; extract each problem
   into the question format of `js/data-questions.js`
   (`{id, topic, difficulty, q, choices[5], answer, sol}`), converting math to KaTeX-renderable form.
3. Merge extracted questions into the bank (namespaced ids, e.g. `cpg-ch2-p14`), keeping
   the 20 preview questions as a `preview` source that can be filtered out.
4. Recompute mastery denominators; unlock the mock-exam simulator (below).

## 4. Timed mock-exam simulator — *status: SHIPPED (July 15, 2026)*

Implemented as designed below (`js/exam-engine.js` + `js/view-exam.js`). The 100 × 170
legacy mode replays Sample Exams 1–3 verbatim; the 70 × 120 mode draws by official
weights (largest-remainder apportionment, prefer-unseen). In-progress sittings persist
and resume across reloads; the countdown is wall-clock-based (background-tab throttling
can't buy time). Blanks and misses feed the mistake book; every question logs an
attempt row `mode:'exam'` for analytics. Original design:

### Formats
- **Current (default):** 70 questions · 120 minutes — the revised test (since Sept 2023).
- **Legacy mode:** 100 questions · 170 minutes — matches released ETS practice PDFs
  (GR8677, GR9277, GR9677, GR0177, GR1777), which the study plan schedules on paper meanwhile.

### Exam-room UI
- Full-screen takeover, countdown timer (amber at 15 min, red at 5 min).
- Question palette: grid of numbers — unanswered / answered / flagged-for-review.
- Flag, skip, back-navigation; **no feedback until submission**; optional pause (practice integrity note shown).
- Question order: fixed random seed per session; topic distribution follows official weights
  (CM 20%, EM 18%, QM 13%, TS 10%, AP 10%, ST 9%, OW 8%, SR 6%, LM 6%).

### Scoring & results
- Raw score = number correct (no guessing penalty on the current test).
- Approximate scaled score via a published raw→scaled lookalike table (documented as an estimate).
- Per-topic breakdown chart → feeds the "weakest topics" ranking used by Phase 3 plan tasks.
- Session history stored in state (`state.exams[]`: date, format, raw, scaled-est, per-topic, duration used).

### Gamification hooks (reserved ids)
- XP: +150 completion, +1 per correct.
- Achievements to add when it ships: *First Full Sim* (bronze), *Marathoner* — 3 sims (silver),
  *Peak Performer* — ≥85% raw (gold), *Simulated Victory* — beat your previous sim score twice (gold).

### Data model sketch
```js
state.exams = [{
  id, startedAt, format: '70x120' | '100x170',
  seed, answers: {qid: choiceIdx}, flags: [qid],
  submittedAt, raw, scaledEst, perTopic: {cm: {right, total}, ...}
}]
```

## 4b. Attempt history, mistake book & formula recall — *status: shipped*

Three linked subsystems (all state in `localStorage`, so export/restore covers them;
scheduling in `js/srs.js`):

### Per-attempt history (`#/history`, `js/view-history.js`)
Every answer is appended to `state.attempts` — full logging, not aggregates
(a deliberate choice): `{ ts, qid, topic, picked, answer, correct, ms, sid, mode }`.
Each practice run / mistake drill is a row in `state.sessions`
(`{ id, mode, topicId, startedAt, endedAt, planned, answered, correct, xp }`), kept
live per answer so abandoned sessions still show real progress. Size budget: an
attempt is ~120 bytes of JSON; even 10,000 attempts ≈ 1.2 MB, comfortably inside
the ~5 MB localStorage quota for a one-exam-cycle site.

### Mistake book (`#/mistakes`, `js/view-mistakes.js`)
A miss creates/updates `state.mistakes[qid]`: first/last missed, every distinct
wrong pick, miss/solve counts, and a review schedule. Rules (user-chosen):
- **Permanent.** Solving a mistake never removes it — it climbs the ladder
  **1 → 3 → 7 → 14 → 30 → 60 days** (capped at 60). A new miss resets to step 0
  (due tomorrow). The only removal is the user's manual **Archive** (reversible;
  archived entries are hidden from drills and due counts; a fresh miss reopens them).
- Portal shows the wrong pick beside the correct answer and solution; re-drill
  (due / all / single) reuses the practice answering pipeline with `mode: 'mistakes'`,
  so drills earn normal XP and log attempts like any answer.

### Formula recall (`#/formulas`, `js/view-formulas.js`, deck: `js/data-formulas.js`)
Vocabulary-app flip cards: prompt → flip → self-grade **Again / Hard / Good / Easy**.
SM-2-style scheduling per card in `state.cards` (`ease` 1.3–3.0 starting 2.5;
Again resets reps and repeats within the session; Hard ×1.2; Good ×ease; Easy
×ease×1.3 — button labels preview the exact next interval). `gradeCard` also stamps
`lastReviewedDay` (LOCAL date) — the `studiedToday` source of truth (never compare a
UTC ISO prefix to a local date string).

**Progressive daily batch** (replaces the old "every never-studied card is due"
cram queue). `settings.formulaDailyTarget` is a **total** daily cap of reviews + new
combined (clamp **1–100**, default **10**; every read routes the raw value through
`srs.clampTarget`, so an imported/corrupt value can't poison the queue). `state.formulaDay`
= `{ date, reviewIds: [], newIds: [] }` holds today's batch, rebuilt at the day roll and
reconciled on every access (`srs.formulaDay(deck)`, persisted only when it changed; an
empty deck returns a transient batch WITHOUT persisting, guarding the nav-badge path that
runs before IndexedDB resolves):
- **Build:** reviews = cards with state and `due ≤ today`, **oldest-due first**, first
  `min(T, all)`; new = random sample of never-studied cards filling `max(0, T − reviews)` slots.
- **Reconcile (same day):** drop ids no longer in the deck; keep every `studiedToday`
  member unconditionally; if over target trim only non-studied items (new picks from the
  end, then unstudied reviews newest-due first — oldest-due kept); if under target top up
  with due reviews (oldest first) then random never-studied cards.
- **Remaining** = batch cards where **(no state) OR (`due ≤ today`)** — an Again-graded
  card (due today) stays remaining across reloads; a Good/Hard/Easy card (future due) is done.
- **Overflow:** due reviews held back from today's batch are **postponed** to tomorrow
  (counted on the composition line).
- **New-card slots** are filled by the **picker** (topic-grouped checklist; `studiedToday`
  picks are locked and preserved verbatim, counting toward the slot tally) or **random
  auto-fill** / re-roll. Slots `S = max(0, T − reviews)`; when `S = 0` the new-card controls
  are hidden.

Remaining count drives the dashboard *Review queue* card and the sidebar badge.
**Browse** the deck via **Learned** (cards with state: last-grade + due chips) / **Upcoming**
(no state: "new" chip) sub-tabs; batch members carry a "today" chip; a row click toggles a
view-only peek (front/back/note, no schedule mutation). **In-session back-stepping:** every
grade is pushed to `study.history`; a "Back" control (or ←) opens a view-only peek of graded
cards (older/newer/Resume).

**Session mechanics (Study mode only; Match/Type/Quiz commit `gradeCard` directly — no steps).**
- **Exam-date cap (F3):** `settings.examDate` (default `2026-10-28`, editable via the Today card's
  date input). `srs.examCap()` = `max(1, min(days−1, ceil(0.2·days)))`, null when the date is
  invalid/past (capping silently off). `nextIntervals` clamps hard/good/easy to the cap (Again
  stays 0), so grade-button previews match reality. **Final pass** (`srs.finalPassActive()`, active
  `0 < days ≤ 7`): every card with state becomes review-eligible (overdue first, then future-due
  learned cards, oldest-due first); `formulaDayRemaining` extends its rule to *(no state) OR
  (due ≤ today) OR (final-pass AND not studied today)*; home shows a "Final pass — N learned
  formulas, D days left (aim for ⌈N/D⌉/day)" banner.
- **Learning steps (F7):** stateless cards graduate on Easy (commit) or on a 2nd Hard/Good; a 1st
  Hard/Good bumps to step 1 (chip "learning 1/2", +2 XP, reinsert 3–5 back, no commit); Again
  resets to step 0 (reinsert, no lapse). `study.done` counts only commits; every press is +2 XP.
- **Undo (F1a):** `study.undo` (max 10, session-scoped) snapshots the whole session + card state
  before each press; a ghost "Undo" (or ⌘/Ctrl+Z) restores it and pops the matching trailing
  `cardReviews` entry. Overlays block undo.
- **Overlay state machine (F8):** single `study.overlay` (`null|'peek'|'scaffold'|'checkpoint'`)
  routes the keyboard — peek ←/→/Esc, scaffold/checkpoint space·Enter = continue, null = flip/grade/
  ←-peek/undo. "Rebuild hints" (pre-flip) and a post-Again interstitial show 5 reconstruction
  prompts. When a round-closing press is an Again, scaffold precedes checkpoint.
- **Rounds (F11):** every `ROUND_SIZE = 10` presses, a checkpoint overlay offers Keep going / Finish.
- **Interleaving (F9):** `interleaveByTopic` (view) round-robins the session queue across topics;
  `srs._sampleSpread` stratifies new-card auto-fill / re-roll across topics (`_sample` kept for others).

**Insight & browse (bundle 2).**
- **Review log:** `srs.gradeCard` appends `state.cardReviews` (capped 8000) `{ d, id, g, ivl, m: was-mature
  (ivl≥21), n: had-prior-state }` — captured *before* mutation. All modes flow through `gradeCard`, so the
  log is complete; F1a undo pops the matching trailing entry.
- **Leeches (F2):** `srs.isLeech(st)` = `st.lapses ≥ 8`. Learned browse rows carry a warning "leech" chip;
  home shows "N formulas keep slipping" + a **Drill N struggling** button → a normal-grading session over the
  leech cards, independent of the daily batch.
- **Mnemonic notes (F2):** `state.cardNotes` (id → `{ text, updatedAt }`, plain text). Browse peek (both tabs)
  has an Add/Edit-mnemonic textarea; Study reveal renders the mnemonic under the card note.
- **Reverse direction (F5):** `settings.formulaReverse` (Today-card toggle). When true, Study shows `back`
  as the question ("What is this? When does it apply?") and reveals name + `front` + note + mnemonic. Same
  SM-2 state/grading; games, print, browse unaffected.
- **Memory stats (F10):** collapsible home card. Maturity mix (mature `interval≥21`; young `reps>0 &&
  interval<21`; learning/new = rest). 30-day retention from `cardReviews` (n=1 only): pass rate of `g≠again`
  among `m=1` (mature) / `m=0` (young); <20 qualifying entries → "collecting data". 14-day due forecast
  (day 0 includes overdue) as div bars + a 30-day total line.

Game pools (Match/Type/Quiz/Cloze) are restricted to the **remaining batch + already-studied
cards** — games never introduce never-studied cards outside the daily cap/picker.

**Games sharpening (F4/F6/F1b — `js/flashmodes.js`).** Games commit `gradeCard` directly
(no learning steps — those are Study-only). *Type (F4):* the auto-check is a verdict line
("Auto-check: matched / no match"); the user grades on the full **Again/Hard/Good/Easy**
scale (keys 1–4), with the auto-check result preselected (matched→Good, miss→Again) and
**Enter** confirming the highlight. `acceptSet` also matches the legend-stripped back and an
optional `c.alts` array. *Quiz (F6):* `stripLegend(back)` keeps only the leading `$$…$$`/`$…$`
block (drops the symbol legend) for **display** — grading stays index-based. `perturbLatex(back)`
builds near-miss distractors from the legend-stripped formula (brace-depth aware): flip a
top-level ±, `^2`↔`^3`, add/remove a `\frac{1}{2}` factor, `2\pi`↔`\pi`, swap a top-level
fraction, `\sin`↔`\cos`; each variant must `normText`-differ from the correct string and every
other, and must render (`katexOK`, KaTeX `throwOnError`) or it is discarded. Options = correct +
up to 3 variants, then same-topic then any-topic legend-stripped backs. *Undo (F1b):* Type and
Quiz keep a **one-level** undo of the last committed grade `{ id, prevState, counter snapshots }`
— a ghost **Undo** link restores `state.cards[id]`, pops the matching trailing `cardReviews`
entry, rolls back the mode's score/XP counters, and hides itself; the undone question is not
replayed and the stack clears at round end.

**Cloze mode (bundle 4 — `startCloze`).** One top-level term of the (legend-stripped) formula is
blanked to `\boxed{?}` and the player picks the missing token from four KaTeX chips. Generation is
conservative — `clozeCandidates` tokenizes the side after the first top-level `=` (else the whole
expression), brace-depth aware, and blanks one of: an integer/decimal **coefficient**, a small
numeric `\frac{p}{q}`, an **exponent** (`^2`/`^{3/2}` — re-wrapped as `^{\boxed{?}}`, chips are the
content), `\pi`/`n\pi`, or a trig/`exp`/`ln`/`log` **function name** (a top-level ± is a candidate too
but can't form four distinct chips, so it self-skips). Distractors are token-scale perturbations
(`clozeDistractors`), falling back to same-category tokens **harvested from the whole deck**
(`clozeHarvest`); each chip and the boxed formula must render (`katexOK`) or the candidate/card is
dropped. Right → `gradeCard` Good (+2 XP), wrong → Again with the correct chip highlighted and a brief
auto-advance pause. Pool = `pickQueue` policy filtered to cloze-able cards, cap 12 (`clozePool`); the
intro tile shows the round size, or "No cloze-able cards in today's pool yet." when it's empty.

Card ids are **equation-numbered and assumed stable** across re-imports; a re-import that
renumbers ids resets card progress (known limitation).

**The deck ships empty by design** — cards come only from the book import
(parser v2 appends to `PGRE.FORMULAS` or stores
`{ id: 'formula-deck', kind: 'formula-deck', cards: [...] }` in IndexedDB;
`PGRE.formulaDeck()` merges both). Keyboard: space flips, 1–4 grade, ← steps back.

## 5. Review plan (data: `js/data-plan.js`)

Jul 13 → Oct 28, 2026 · **intensive ~15–17 h/week** · three phases:

1. **Foundation Pass (W1–W9, Jul 13–Sep 13)** — one deep pass over all 9 topics in
   exam-weight order (CM, CM, EM, EM, OW, TS, QM, QM+AP, AP+SR), building a formula
   sheet page per topic.
2. **Second Pass & Practice Tests (W10–W13, Sep 14–Oct 11)** — finish LM+ST, then fast
   re-sweeps; one full released ETS exam per week (GR8677 → GR9277 → GR9677 → GR0177),
   timed, on paper; miss-classification feeds a weak-topic list.
3. **Sharpen & Taper (W14–W16, Oct 12–28)** — data-driven drilling of the 3 weakest
   topics, GR1777 + final mock, memorization sweep, logistics, taper. Exam Wednesday Oct 28.

Weeks render as collapsible cards; the current week auto-opens; checking tasks grants XP once.

## 6. Design-system notes (dataviz conventions applied)

- Meters: fill = accent terracotta; track = lighter step of the same hue (never gray).
- Stat tiles: sentence-case label, sans-semibold value, proportional figures.
- Status (correct/incorrect) always icon + label, never color alone; green/red reserved
  for status, never decoration.
- Text never wears data color; identity comes from a colored mark beside the text.
- Single-series meters carry no legend.

## 7. Deliberately out of scope (for now)

- Accounts, sync, server anything — the point is local.
- Question shuffle of choices (kept in authored order, GRE-style).
- ~~Dark mode~~ — shipped July 15, 2026 as the planned `data-theme` layer (see §8).

## 8. Feature waves — *shipped July 15, 2026 (all 15 PROPOSAL items)*

Everything in `PROPOSAL.md` was built in three orchestrated waves (infra → features →
theme/polish), each implementation reviewed adversarially and the whole site verified
end-to-end via headless Chrome (per `.claude/skills/verify/SKILL.md`):

- **Infra:** state schema v2 (`exams`, `notes`, `bookmarks`, `settings`, `studyLog`,
  attempt `confidence`), `js/bank.js` source merge, `js/study-time.js` passive active-time
  tracker, `js/notes.js` API, routes/nav for `#/analytics` `#/build` `#/search` `#/notes`,
  4 mock-exam achievements.
- **#1 Mock-exam simulator** (§4) · **#2 Analytics** (`#/analytics`: weekly accuracy trend,
  points-lost-per-topic ranking, time histogram vs pace budget, volume heatmap, sims table)
  · **#3 Custom quiz builder** (`#/build`: topics × difficulty × unseen/missed/slowest/
  bookmarked, exam-source opt-in, deep link `#/build/topic-<id>`) · **#4 Pace trainer**
  (settings-driven, 103 s default) · **#5 Flashcard modes** (Match / Type-to-recall /
  Auto-quiz in `js/flashmodes.js`, SRS-integrated) · **#6 Confidence tagging** (knew-it/
  guessed; lucky guesses enter the mistake book, cleared on a confident re-solve) ·
  **#7 Question of the day** (dashboard, date-seeded) · **#8 Notes & bookmarks**
  (`#/notes`) · **#9 Search** (`#/search`, all sources incl. book sections & notes) ·
  **#10 Readiness estimate** (dashboard, labeled estimate, blends sims) · **#11 Study-time
  tracking** (dashboard card vs 15–17 h target) · **#12 Distractor explanations**
  (`choiceSols` mined from the book's worked solutions; shown in practice feedback, exam
  review, mistake book) · **#13 Print/PDF** (`css/print.css`: paper mistake book +
  per-topic formula sheets) · **#14 Keyboard-first practice** (A–E/1–5, Enter, G;
  gated on `settings.keyboard`) · **#15 Dark mode** (tokenized palette,
  `[data-theme="dark"]`, sidebar toggle, per-theme heatmap/amber tokens).
